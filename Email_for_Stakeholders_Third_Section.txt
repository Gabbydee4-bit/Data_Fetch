Subject: Data Quality Findings and Key Insights from Fetch Data Analysis

Hi Katie,

I hope you are doing well.

I have completed an initial analysis of the data you provided, and here are some key findings;

Key Data Quality Issues:
1. Missing Data:
   - User data: `birth_date`, `gender`, and `language` fields have a high number of missing entries.  
   - Product data: `category_4`, `manufacturer`, and `brand` fields are incomplete for many records.  
   - Transaction data: `final_quantity` and `final_sale` have many entries with non-numeric or placeholder values.  

2. Duplicates:  
   - We found duplicate records in both the product (215 rows) and transaction (171 rows) datasets, which may skew reporting and analysis.  
   
I also noticed that some transactions lack associated product details which make it more difficult to fully analyze the behavior of purphase, there are some inconsistency in the user and transaction data. A small percentage of users have unrealistic or missing values which may affect age-based segmentation. Also there are duplicate in the dataset for products and transaction. Which could inflate certain metrics. My question in this is that do we have a deduplication process in place?
A small group of users account for a disproportionately high number of scanned receipts. If we introduce targeted engagement strategies, we could further enhance user retention.

My suggestion is that to refine our analysis and ensure accuracy, we could use:
1. Data collection processes could be used such as receipt scanning and processing,product and brand information by partnerships with the brands and retailers, User Behavior Tracking not forgeting that data must be anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy while generating insights, Metadata such as transaction timestamps and location data may be logged for trend analysis.
2. Focusing on optimizing user engagement strategies or identifying opportunities to strengthen brand partnerships based on these insights
3. Implement or enhance our data deduplication processes to ensure cleaner data

Please let me know if you would like a deeper dive into any specific areas. Looking forward to your thoughts!
