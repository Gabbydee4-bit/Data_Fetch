USERS
1. One of the data quality issues I identify for the user data, there are alot of missing informations, example the Birth_Date, State, Language and Gender has alot of missing columns
2. There also some data inconsistency in the Language column such as es-419. I do not think that a language type will contain numeric data type

TRANSACTIONS
1. I observe that there are missing data in the transaction data, barcode seems to contain alot of missing value
2. There are alot of inconsistency in the Final_quantity column which contains "zero" instead of numeric value
3. The Final_sales column should contain a uniform decimal points, I notice that there were some entries without any decimal points and some plain (zero) value
4. In the transaction data, 171 duplicate values found.

PRODUCTS
1. I observe that the products data contains alot of missing data from all the columns
2. What is the need of having four different categories
3. In the Products data, 215 duplicate values found
