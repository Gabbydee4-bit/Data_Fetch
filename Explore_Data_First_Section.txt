USERS
1. One of the data quality issues I identified for the user data, is that there are a lot of missing information, example the Birth_Date, State, Language and Gender columns have a lot of missing values.
2. There also some data inconsistency in the Language column such as es-419. I do not think that a language type will contain numeric data type.

TRANSACTIONS
1. I observed that there are missing data in the transaction data, barcode seems to contain a lot of missing values.
2. There are a lot of inconsistency in the Final_Quantity column which contains "zero"(string) instead of numeric value.
3. The Final_Sales column should contain a uniform decimal point. I noticed that there were some entries without any decimal point and some plain zero (0) value
4. In the transaction data, 171 duplicate values were found.

PRODUCTS
1. I observed that the products data contains a lot of missing data for almost all the columns.
2. What is the need of having four different categories? Can it not be simplified?
3. In the Products data, 215 duplicate values were found.
